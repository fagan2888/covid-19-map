# covid-19-map

![](covid-19-map.png)

Creates a map using data from [@nytimes](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) that tracks the spread of Covid-19.

Jupyter notebook performs some simple cleaning, downloads and merges with US Census shapefiles, generates a static and then interactive plot (from Bokeh). This largely builds on my research from [US-China trade war](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/consumption_and_tradewar).

- Datafrom: Nytimes github repo [https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) Data from The New York Times, based on reports from state and local health agencies.

- Interactive map with hover tool here:

- **TO DO** Will add demographic data from US Census soon and hover tool will report it.
